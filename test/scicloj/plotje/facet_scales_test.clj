(ns scicloj.plotje.facet-scales-test
  "Tests for facet scale coordination (the :scales option).

   Default behavior is :shared -- all facet panels carry the same
   x-domain and y-domain so panels are visually comparable. The
   :scales opt overrides per axis: :free-y (x shared, y per-panel),
   :free-x (y shared, x per-panel), :free (both per-panel).

   Coordination only fires for :facet-grid layouts. Multi-variable
   composite layouts keep per-panel domains because aggregating across
   different x/y columns is meaningless."
