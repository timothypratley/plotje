  "A grid built from a rectangular pair list -- the SPLOM shape that
   `pj/pose` with `pj/cross` produces -- draws one x axis per column
   and one y axis per row, and suppresses the rest.

   That is only readable if a cell's x really is constant down its
   column and its y constant across its row. When the grid was built
   the other way round, the suppression still kept the bottom row's x
   ticks and the leftmost column's y ticks, so every other row and
   column was left with no axis of its own and a reader took a
   neighbour's numbers for its own: on the grid below, petal-width
   points (never above 2.5) sat under a y axis reading to 6.

   These tests pin both halves -- the arrangement, and the tick
   labels that arrangement is supposed to make readable."
