;; # Wide and Long
;;
;; A table carrying several measures can be written two ways. **Wide**
;; gives each measure a column of its own. **Long** gives them one
;; value column and a key column naming which measure a row holds.
;; `tc/pivot->longer` and `tc/pivot->wider` move between the two and
;; lose nothing.
;;
;; This notebook proposes that Plotje's layout vocabulary has a
;; wide-side reading and a long-side reading of the same questions,
;; that most of its constructs come in pairs across that line, and that
;; the pairs were built separately and drifted. It then shows the
;; wide-side reading this branch adds, and the four repairs that came
;; with it.
;;
;; It is a design document rather than a chapter. The book teaches what
;; exists; this argues for what should, so it is not in
;; `notebooks/chapters.edn`. Every number below is measured here and
;; checked by a test that runs with the suite.

;; ## The pairs

;; Most of what decides where a mark goes has a reading on each side.

;; | the question | long side, from a column's **values** | wide side, from **column names** |
;; |:--|:--|:--|
;; | several measures shown together | `:color`, `:group` | several columns in one slot |
;; | several measures in their own panels | `pj/facet` | a vector of pairs, `pj/cross` |
;; | whether those panels share a scale | `:scales` | `:share-scales` |
;; | how competitors share a place | `:position` | *absent* |

;; Outside the line entirely: `pj/arrange`, `:layout` and `pj/marginal`
;; read no columns and no values. That is why `pj/arrange` is the
;; universal escape hatch -- it works on either side because it never
;; looks at the data.
;;
;; And one construct on the wide side only, rightly: an interval's
;; `:x-min` and `:x-max`, and an errorbar's `:y-min` and `:y-max`. A
;; mark needs both ends of an interval at once, so a long form with a
;; bound column would have nothing to draw. One side only is not
;; automatically a gap.

;; **The opposite defaults are right, which is the interesting part.**
;; Facet panels are one column split by a key, so their values are
;; commensurable by construction and sharing is safe. Pairs-grid panels
;; hold different columns, so sharing is a claim about the data rather
;; than a fact. Collapsing the two settings under one default would
;; break whichever side lost.

;; ## What the wide side can and cannot do

;; A position adjustment divides a band among **labelled**
;; competitors. Two layers over wide data are labelled by the column
;; each draws -- overlaid, they disagree about a column, so they are
;; told apart by a colour and a legend, and that label is what the
;; dodge divides by:

(-> sales-wide
    pj/overlay
    (pj/lay-bar :quarter :revenue {:position :dodge})
    (pj/lay-bar :quarter :cost {:position :dodge}))

(->> (pj/plan (-> sales-wide pj/overlay
                  (pj/lay-bar :quarter :revenue {:position :dodge})
                  (pj/lay-bar :quarter :cost {:position :dodge})))
     :panels first :layers
     (mapv (fn [l] {:n-groups (:n-groups (:dodge-ctx l))
                    :labels (mapv :label (:groups l))})))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [ls] (= [{:n-groups 2 :labels ["revenue"]}
               {:n-groups 2 :labels ["cost"]}] ls))])

;; `:stack` and `:fill` are a different matter, and the wide side
;; cannot do them. A dodge is an annotation: it records which slot of
;; a band each mark takes, and the slots are counted across every
;; layer that dodges, so two layers can share them. Stacking and
;; filling rewrite the values themselves, accumulating each group's
;; on top of the one before it -- and that accumulation runs within
;; one layer, over its own groups. Two layers have no group in common
;; to accumulate across, so each is piled on itself and nothing moves.
;;
;; The bar tops each adjustment produces, wide against long:

;; So the two sides differ in what an adjustment can reach, not in
;; whether the marks are labelled: **a dodge divides labelled
;; competitors wherever they are, and a stack needs their values in
;; one layer.**

;; ## The pivot is invertible on the data and not on the plot

;; The two shapes hold the same information and do not draw the same
;; pictures. Each can do something the other cannot.
;;
;; **Several layers over wide data can differ in kind** -- a bar with a
;; line across it, different stats, different options per layer:

(-> sales-wide
    pj/overlay
    (pj/lay-bar :quarter :revenue)
    (pj/lay-line :quarter :cost {:color "#e6550d"}))

;; **One grouped layer over long data can have its groups placed

;; is no defect, and `:tooltip` is left alone.

;; **Two decisions this does not take.**

;;   produced the panels. The two already disagree about whether a
;;   categorical axis can be shared at all, one unioning the categories
;;   and the other reporting that a union domain is undefined. It is
;;   the largest change of the set and the only one that would move
;;   behaviour a reader depends on.
;; - **A fourth `:layout` direction** for two cells sharing a canvas.
;;   The geometry is a few lines; what it needs is chrome -- a
;;   transparent cell background, an axis that can draw on the right,
;;   and the tick-suppression keys made public. It should be called
;;   `:inset` rather than `:overlay`, with `:insets` required, because
;;   `:overlay true` on a composite already says where a *layer* lands
;;   rather than where a *cell* is drawn.

;; ## The test this frame gives
;;
;; For any new layout feature: **what is this on the other side of the
;; pivot?**
;;
;; - If there is a twin, build one thing rather than two. Both existing
;;   twins were built separately and drifted.
;; - If there is no twin, say why. The interval endpoints have none and
;;   need none.
;; - If the twin exists and is missing, ask whether it is missing for
;;   the label reason. Grouping and position adjustment both were, and
;;   one change answered both.
;;
;; Where the frame stops: it says nothing about `pj/arrange`,
;; `:layout` or `pj/marginal`, which read neither columns nor values.
;; That is the right silence -- those are geometry, and geometry has no
;; wide and no long.
