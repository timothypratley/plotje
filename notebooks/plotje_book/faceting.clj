;; # Faceting
;;
;; Faceting splits data into subsets and draws each in its own panel,
;; making it easy to compare patterns across groups.
;;
;; A facet is a mapping: `:col` and `:row` are aesthetics, and
;; `pj/facet` is the call that writes one. Everything else follows
;; from that -- a facet reaches into a composite, a cell can override
;; the facet it inherits, and several columns under `:col` unite into
;; one distinction. The sections below teach those ideas, and the
;; Examples section at the end shows faceted plots of several kinds.

;; ## What the scope rules give

;; Mappings flow downward: a mapping written on a pose reaches every

;; ### A composite can be faceted

;; Three panels in the top row and one in the bottom row.

;; ### A facet multiplies the panels a pose already draws

;; A pose whose layers name different columns draws a panel for each
;; place. Faceting such a pose draws every one of those panels once

;; `pj/marginal` builds a fresh leaf rather than a descendant, so the
;; scope rules do not reach it on their own. It carries the panel
;; aesthetics across itself, giving a faceted main panel a marginal
;; above each of its panels. The strip label is drawn once per column,
;; at the top.

;; ## Several columns as one key

;; Under some aesthetics, several columns in a vector are one
;; distinction made of those columns united -- a compound key. That is
;; what `{:group [:a :b]}` means, and the panel aesthetics read a vector
;; the same way. `pj/compound-key-aesthetics` names the set, and it is
