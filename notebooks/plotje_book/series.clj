;; # Series
;;
;; A table often carries one measure per column. Writing several of
;; those columns where one goes reads them as several series of one
;; layer: Plotje pivots them, invents a key column naming which measure
;; a row holds and a value column holding the number, and maps the key
;; column to `:color`. Because the measures are labelled, they can be
;; placed against each other by a position adjustment.
;;
;; The sections up to Examples teach the main ideas in order: what a
;; series is, what the pivot makes of the columns it reads, where a
;; series may be written, how the measures are placed against each
;; other, how a series on each axis is read in pairs, and the limits a
;; series has.

;; ## Naming the key column

;; A series can be written out as a map rather than a bare vector. The

;; ## The keys a series takes

;; A series written out takes three keys: `:series` for the columns it

;; ## Where a series is written

;; A series goes wherever a column goes. Written on the pose it
;; reaches every layer below it, which is what scope does for every
;; other mapping -- the pivot reshapes the dataset the pose carries,

;; One pivot per plot, though. A series written in a `lay-*` call on a
;; pose that already reads one is two reshapes of one dataset, and the
;; second would name columns the first consumed, so it is reported:

;; Three partly transparent bars drawn from zero make a third tone
;; wherever they cross, which reads as a stack -- the axis is what

;; ### Column names and missing values

;; #### Column names that look like numbers

;; A wide table often names its measures by year. `tc/pivot->longer`
;; reads a column name that looks like a number as one, so the key
;; column comes out holding numbers rather than text -- and the pivot
;; says that it holds column names, by writing `:color-type
;; :categorical` beside the colour it maps them to. Without it, the
;; colour would read the years as a quantity and draw one gradient over
;; the lot, with every measure in one colour and no legend entry naming
;; either year.

(-> {"country" ["a" "b" "c"]
     "2019"    [10 20 30]
     "2020"    [12 25 28]}

;; A series whose columns are named in words needs none of this, and

;; `tc/pivot->longer` returns either way : the key column keeps the
;; type Tablecloth gave it, and `:color-type` changes only how the
;; colour reads the key column.

;; #### A measure with no value

;; A cell left empty in the wide table has no value to pivot, so that
;; observation is not drawn. Two quarters and two measures are four
;; observations, and three are drawn:

(-> {:quarter ["Q1" "Q2"]
     :revenue [120 nil]

;; #### The key column on the axis

;; Naming the key column on an axis draws the measures against each
