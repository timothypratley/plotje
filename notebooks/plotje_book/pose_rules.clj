;; # Pose Rules
;;
;; Each rule below states one behaviour and shows it on a rendered
;; pose, with the printed structure where the shape is the point.
;;
;; The rules are organized into seven sections (Construction, Layer
;; Placement, Leaf Identity, Scope, Options, Assembly, Layout) and
;; cover every call shape of `pj/pose`, `pj/lay-*`, `pj/arrange`,
;; `pj/overlay`, `pj/options`, `pj/scale`, `pj/coord`, `pj/facet`, and
;; `pj/cross`.
;;
;; Read [Poses](./plotje_book.pose_model.html) first. On a first read
;; through the book you can skim or skip this chapter, and return when
;; you want the precise rule behind a behavior.

(def iris (rdatasets/datasets-iris))

;; A helper to inspect pose structure without `:data` -- the dataset
;; is heavy and not what we are checking. We strip `:data` from the
;; pose and every nested sub-pose and layer.

(defn strip-data [pose]
  (cond-> (dissoc pose :data)
    (:layers pose) (update :layers (partial mapv #(dissoc % :data)))
    (:poses pose) (update :poses (partial mapv strip-data))))

  (kind/pprint (strip-data pose)))

;; ## Overview
;;
;; A **pose** is a plain Clojure map with a documented set of keys:
;;
;; | Key | On | Purpose |
;; |:----|:---|:--------|
;; | `:data` | leaf or any ancestor | dataset (Tablecloth) |
;; | `:mapping` | pose or layer | column-to-aesthetic bindings |
;; | `:layers` | pose | per-scope layers |
;; | `:poses` | composite only | sub-poses |
;; | `:layout` | composite | direction + weights |
;; | `:overlay` | leaf or composite | whether a `lay-*` naming other columns joins the panel rather than taking one of its own, wherever in the pipeline it is written (Rule LP5) |
;; | `:opts` | root | plot-level options (incl. composite-level keys like `:share-scales`) |
;;
;; A **leaf pose** has `:data`, `:mapping`, `:layers`; no `:poses`.
;; A **composite pose** has `:poses`, and a sub-pose may itself be a
;; composite: `pj/arrange` wraps its cells in a row per line of the
;; grid, so the composite it returns holds rows and each row holds
;; cells. A composite the caller supplies is accepted the same way:
;; `pj/arrange` given one among its inputs nests it (Rule C8),
;; `pj/facet` called on one divides every cell of it (Rule O3), and a
;; nested map written out and handed to `pj/pose` is read as written.
;; So a grid inside a grid can be written directly. A **layer**
;; is a map with `:layer-type` and an optional `:mapping`, plus sibling
;; keys `:stat`, `:position`, `:mark` when the user provides them.

;; ---
;; ## Construction
;;
;; How poses and composites come into existence. Nine rules
;; covering every `pj/pose` call shape plus `pj/arrange`.

;; ### Rule C1: `pj/pose` on raw data creates a leaf
;;
;; Called with a dataset as first argument, `pj/pose` returns a
;; leaf pose. The arity determines what's in `:mapping`: a keyword
;; is `:x`; two keywords are `:x` and `:y`; an options map
;; contributes aesthetic keys.

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width))

(kind/test-last [(fn [v] (= 150 (:points (pj/svg-summary v))))])

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    pose-summary)

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (and (= {:x :sepal-length :y :sepal-width} (:mapping pose))
         (= [] (:layers pose))
         (not (contains? pose :poses))))])

;; With only an aesthetic mapping, position is omitted -- the pose
;; is a leaf with no position yet. Inference at render time will
;; handle picking an axis if a layer is added without position.

(-> iris
    (pj/pose {:color :species})
    pose-summary)

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (and (= {:color :species} (:mapping pose))
         (not (contains? pose :poses))))])

;; ### Rule C2: `pj/pose` on an unpositioned leaf extends its mapping
;;
;; A leaf is **unpositioned** if neither its own `:mapping` nor any
;; of its layers' mappings carries `:x` or `:y`. Calling `pj/pose`
;; again on such a leaf merges the new mapping into the leaf's own;
;; the leaf remains a leaf. No composite is created.

(-> iris
    pj/pose
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (and (= {:x :sepal-length :y :sepal-width} (:mapping pose))
         (not (contains? pose :poses))))])

;; And an aesthetic-on-aesthetic extension merges with later-wins:

(-> iris
    (pj/pose {:color :species})
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (= {:x :sepal-length :y :sepal-width :color :species} (:mapping pose)))])

;; **Property P-C2 -- construction commutativity.** A chained
;; unpositioned extension yields a pose structurally equal to the
;; same content expressed as one call.

(= (-> iris
       pj/pose
       (pj/pose {:color :species})
       (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width))
   (pj/pose iris :sepal-length :sepal-width {:color :species}))

(kind/test-last [true?])

;; ### Rule C3: `pj/pose` with position on a positioned leaf promotes to a composite
;;
;; When `pj/pose` is called with position (`:x`/`:y`) on a leaf
;; that already has position, the leaf becomes sub-pose 1 of a new
;; composite and the call becomes sub-pose 2. If the leaf carried
;; aesthetic alongside position, the aesthetic moves to the new
;; composite's **root** `:mapping` and flows to every sub-pose; the
;; position stays with sub-pose 1.

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (and (= 2 (count (:poses pose)))
         (= {:x :sepal-length :y :sepal-width}
            (:mapping (first (:poses pose))))
         (= {:x :petal-length :y :petal-width}
            (:mapping (second (:poses pose))))))])

;; When the leaf carried aesthetic + position, promotion splits
;; them -- aesthetic goes to root (flows to both panels), position
;; stays with sub-pose 1:

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width {:color :species})
    (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width))

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width {:color :species})
    (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width)
    pose-summary)

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (and (= {:color :species} (:mapping pose))
         (= {:x :sepal-length :y :sepal-width}
            (:mapping (first (:poses pose))))
         (= {:x :petal-length :y :petal-width}
            (:mapping (second (:poses pose))))))])

;; **Property P-C3 -- plot-level options stay at root on promotion.**
;; A `:title` set via `pj/options` before promotion does not demote
;; into sub-pose 1; it lives on the composite root's `:opts`.

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    (pj/options {:title "Iris"})
    (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width))

;; The printed structure shows `:opts {:title "Iris"}` at root and no
;; `:opts` on sub-pose 1:

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    (pj/options {:title "Iris"})
    (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width)

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (and (= "Iris" (get-in pose [:opts :title]))
         (not (contains? (first (:poses pose)) :opts))))])

;; ### Rule C4: aesthetic-only `pj/pose` on a positioned leaf promotes without adding a panel
;;
;; An aesthetic-only call (no `:x`/`:y`) on a positioned leaf
;; wraps the leaf as sub-pose 1 of a new composite and routes the
;; aesthetic to the composite's root `:mapping`. The composite ends
;; up with exactly **one** sub-pose. The purpose is to position the
;; aesthetic at plot scope ahead of any subsequent panel.

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    (pj/pose {:color :species}))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]

         (= {:x :sepal-length :y :sepal-width}
            (:mapping (first (:poses pose))))))])

;; **Property P-C4 -- aesthetic-then-panel equivalence.**
;; Aesthetic-only promotion followed by a position call equals
;; bundling the aesthetic on the initial leaf and then promoting
;; (C3's mapping-split path). Users can switch between the two
;; forms without changing the result.

(= (-> iris
       (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
       (pj/pose {:color :species})
       (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width))
   (-> iris
       (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width {:color :species})
       (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width)))

(kind/test-last [true?])

;; ### Rule C5: layer partitioning at promotion splits layers by position presence
;;
;; When a positioned leaf is promoted (via C3 or C4), each layer
;; is partitioned by a single test: a layer whose own `:mapping`
;; contains `:x` or `:y` is **panel-origin** and stays with
;; sub-pose 1; otherwise it is **root-origin** and moves to the
;; composite's root `:layers`, flowing to every sub-pose at plan
;; time. No whitelist; the layer's own mapping is self-describing.

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    pj/lay-point
    (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]

         (= 2 (count (:poses pose)))
         (= [] (:layers (first (:poses pose))))
         (= [] (:layers (second (:poses pose))))))])

;; The bare `pj/lay-point` call is root-origin: at render time it
;; reaches both panels. Had we passed position --
;; `(pj/lay-point :sepal-length :sepal-width)` -- the layer would
;; stay with sub-pose 1.

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)

             (= [] (:layers pose)))
         (= 1 (count (:layers (first (:poses pose)))))
         (= [] (:layers (second (:poses pose))))))])

;; ### Rule C6: `pj/pose` on a composite dispatches by call shape
;;
;; Already a composite? The dispatch is:
;;
;; - **Position-carrying call** -- append a new sub-pose to `:poses`.
;; - **Aesthetic-only call** -- merge the aesthetic into the root
;;   `:mapping` (no new sub-pose).
;; - **Empty call** -- has no effect (see C7).

             {:x :sepal-length :y :petal-length}]
            (mapv :mapping (:poses pose)))))])

;; An aesthetic-only call on a composite merges into root, leaving
;; sub-poses alone:

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width)
    (pj/pose {:color :species}))

         (= {:x :sepal-length :y :sepal-width}
            (:mapping (first (:poses pose))))))])

;; ### Rule C7: empty `pj/pose` on an existing pose has no effect
;;
;; `(pj/pose pose)` where `pose` is a leaf or a composite returns `pose`
;; unchanged. This makes the 1-arity `pj/pose` safe to use as a
;; pipeline step that does nothing.

;; A leaf pose. First the rendered plot, then its structure:

(def leaf-pose (-> iris (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)))

leaf-pose

(pose-summary leaf-pose)

;; Wrapping it with 1-arity `pj/pose` returns the same value:

(= leaf-pose (pj/pose leaf-pose))

(kind/test-last [true?])

;; A composite pose. The rendered plot, then its structure:

(def composite-pose
  (-> iris
      (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
      (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width)))

composite-pose

(pose-summary composite-pose)

;; And again, 1-arity `pj/pose` has no effect:

(= composite-pose (pj/pose composite-pose))

(kind/test-last [true?])

;; ### Rule C8: `pj/arrange` composes poses into a composite
;;
;; `pj/arrange` takes a sequence of poses (leaves in alpha) plus
;; optional layout options and returns a composite. The inputs become
;; the composite's `:poses`, wrapped in a 2-level row-and-column
;; layout.

;; ### Rule C9: 3-arity `pj/pose` with a pair sequence and opts folds aesthetic-attach into multi-pair
;;
;; When `pj/pose` receives three arguments where the second is a
;; pair sequence (a vector of `[x y]` pairs, typically the output
;; of `pj/cross`) and the third is an options map, the call is
;; equivalent to two chained calls: the opts mapping is attached to

;; flat one-panel-per-pair composite). The aesthetic lands on the
;; composite root and flows to every cell.

;; ## Layer Placement
;;
;; Where `lay-*` calls place the layer in the pose tree.
;; Five rules covering whether the call names `:x` and `:y`, whether
;; the receiver is a leaf or a composite, the raw-data convenience
;; case, and the `:overlay` key that reverses the non-matching
;; outcome.
;;
;; **Position storage:** when a `lay-*` call carries position, the
;; position lives on the **layer's own `:mapping`**. The leaf being
;; attached to (or created for) also carries position in its own
;; `:mapping` where appropriate -- both resolve to the same effective
;; `:x`/`:y` via scope merge. The layer's own `:mapping` is the
;; authoritative record of what the user typed and is what C5 inspects
;; at promotion.

;; ### Rule LP1: bare `lay-*` attaches at the current pose's root
;;
;; A `lay-*` call without position arguments attaches the layer to
;; the current pose's top-level `:layers`. On a leaf, that is the
;; leaf's own `:layers`. On a composite, it is the root `:layers`,
;; and the layer flows into every descendant leaf when rendered.

;; same "most recent matching leaf" rule the teaching chapters
;; describe, formalized for composite poses where reading-order
;; depth-first traversal gives the precise answer. Matching is by
;; strict equality: a column reference is the keyword or string the
;; user typed, and the two forms are not interchangeable.

;;
;; The example is a dataset rather than a map literal, because the rule
;; reads an order and a Clojure map does not carry one.

;; ## Assembly
;;
;; How the rules above combine to produce rendered layers. Each

;; pair, with all ancestor scope merged in.

;; ### Rule A1: one rendered layer per applicable (leaf, layer) pair
;;
;; For each leaf, the number of rendered layers equals the number
;; of layers applicable to that leaf -- the leaf's own plus all
;; ancestor root-origin layers.

;; ### Rule A2: each rendered layer carries fully merged scope
;;
;; Every layer rendered in the final plot reflects the full scope
;; merge: the dataset, every mapping (positions and aesthetics)
;; that flows into it, and the layer-type bundle (plus any
;; `:stat`, `:position`, `:mark` overrides). No scope level is

;; ## Layout
;;
;; How leaves become panels in the rendered plot. Five rules
;; covering single panels, overlays, faceting, composite grids with
;; shared scales, and the SPLOM reshape of multi-pair poses.

;; ### Rule L1: each leaf produces a panel block
;;
;; Each leaf produces one **panel block** in the rendered plot. The
;; block holds one panel per place its layers name, and `pj/facet` or
;; `pj/facet-grid` multiplies those by the facet values (or by the
;; (row, col) pairs). A leaf whose layers all name one place, unfaceted,
;; is a single panel.

(-> iris
    (pj/pose :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width)
    pj/lay-point)

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (let [plan (pj/plan pose)]

;; One leaf whose layers name two places is two panels in one block:

(-> iris
    (pj/lay-point :sepal-length :sepal-width)
    (pj/lay-point :petal-length :petal-width))

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [pose]
    (and (nil? (:poses pose))
         (= 2 (:panels (pj/svg-summary pose)))))])

;; ### Rule L2: layers naming one place overlay within that place's panel
;;
;; Layers applicable to a leaf (the leaf's own plus all ancestor
;; root-origin layers) that name the same place draw on the same axis
;; pair -- they overlay within each panel for that place, not on
;; separate panels. Layers naming different places take a panel each,
;; unless `:overlay` puts them together (Rule LP5).

          panel (first (:panels plan))]
      (and (= 1 (count (:panels plan)))
           (= 2 (count (:layers panel))))))])

;; ### Rule L3: faceting splits each leaf into panels by category
;;
;; `pj/facet :col` produces one panel per unique value of `:col`;
;; `pj/facet-grid :row-col :col-col` produces one panel per (row,
;; col) pair.

;; ### Rule L4: composite layout is controlled by `:layout` and optional `:share-scales`
;;
;; A composite pose carries a `:layout` map (set by `pj/arrange`
;; options: `:cols`, `:width`, `:height`, `:title`) controlling
;; the grid of its sub-poses' panel blocks. An optional
;; `:share-scales` (subset of `#{:x :y}`) enables column-bucketed
;; shared-scale resolution across sub-poses.
;;
;; **Column-bucketing**: when `:x` is shared, sub-poses whose
;; effective `:x` column is the same share that scale's domain;
;; sub-poses with different `:x` columns get independent
;; x-domains. Same for `:y`. This is what enables SPLOM (one x down
;; each column, one y across each row) and marginal plots: a top strip
;; names the scatter's `:x` and falls in the same bucket, and a right
;; strip names the scatter's `:y` column on its own `:x`, so it falls
;; in a bucket of its own and is pinned to that column's extent there.

;; ### Rule L5: multi-pair `pj/pose` reshapes rectangular pairs into a 2D grid (SPLOM)
;;
;; When `pj/pose` receives a pair-sequence that forms a
;; rectangular M x N Cartesian product (like the output of
;; `pj/cross cols cols`), the result is a nested **rows-of-cols**
;; composite with `:share-scales #{:x :y}` -- the canonical SPLOM
;; layout. A cell's place follows its columns: its `:x` decides which
;; column of the grid it sits in, its `:y` which row. Each cell
;; inherits the base's `:data`, root `:mapping`, and root `:layers`
;; when rendered. The compositor applies these renderer flags on
;; cells:
;;
;; - `:suppress-legend`, `:suppress-x-label` and `:suppress-y-label`
;;   on every cell. One legend is drawn at composite level, and the
;;   strip labels carry the axis-variable names.
;; - `:suppress-x-ticks` on every cell above the bottom row, and
;;   `:suppress-y-ticks` on every cell right of the leftmost column.
;;   Every cell in a grid column carries the same `:x` and every cell
;;   in a row the same `:y`, so the bottom row's numbers describe the
;;   whole of their column and the leftmost column's the whole of
;;   their row.
;;
;; In practice, SPLOM usage therefore omits `pj/lay-point` -- each
;; cell infers its own layer type: scatter off-diagonal, histogram
;; on the diagonal (where x = y). Pair lists that are not
;; rectangular fall through to the flat one-panel-per-pair behaviour
;; (see Rules C3 / C6).

;;
;; `pj/cross` is not a rule. It is a pure pair-generator --
;; `(for [x xs y ys] [x y])` -- returning `[x-col y-col]` pairs. It
;; has no plot-level behavior on its own; the multi-pair arity of
;; `pj/pose` (and `pj/arrange` for independent plots) is what turns
;; the generated sequence into panels, and those cases are already
;; covered by the rules above. `pj/cross` is shown as a
;; SPLOM-construction ingredient in the chart-type and how-to chapters
;; (Scatter, Faceting, Customization), not as a rule.
