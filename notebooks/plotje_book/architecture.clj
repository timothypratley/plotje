;; # Architecture
;;
;; Plotje has a five-stage pipeline: **pose** -> **draft** -> **plan**
;; -> **membrane** -> **plot**. Each stage is produced from the
;; previous one by a single step. The user-facing functions
;; `pj/draft`, `pj/plan`, and `pj/plot` are literal compositions of
;; those steps, with `pj/options` folded in to inject
;; pose-level options. Because the API is built as a composition, you
;; can inspect each intermediate value and test each transition on
;; its own.
;;
;; This chapter introduces the single-step transitions, walks a small example
;; through every stage, shows the user-facing functions as
;; compositions, and explains how composite poses traverse the same
;; pipeline through internal shape dispatch.

;; Two terms used throughout: **data space** is values in their
;; original units (centimeters, dollars, dates, species names);
;; **drawing space** is the drawing-unit coordinates inside the output canvas.
;; The plan stage holds geometry in data space; the membrane stage
;; holds geometry in drawing space.

;; The five stages:
;;
;; - **Pose** -- the composable specification you write. Built by
;;   `pj/pose`, `pj/lay-*`, `pj/options`, `pj/facet`, `pj/arrange`,
;;   `pj/scale`, and `pj/coord`. Lifted from raw data by `pj/->pose`,
;;   so a dataset can flow through the pipeline without an explicit
;;   constructor call. No computation has happened yet.
;;
;; - **Draft** -- the pose flattened. A `LeafDraft` record holds
;;   `:layers` (a vector of one map per applicable layer with all
;;   scope merged in -- `:data`, `:x`, `:y`, `:mark`, `:stat`, and
;;   aesthetic keys) and `:opts` (the pose-level options that flow
;;   into the plan stage). A composite pose produces a
;;   `CompositeDraft` instead, carrying per-leaf drafts
;;   (`:sub-drafts`), the resolved composite-framing geometry (`:chrome-spec`),
;;   the layout map from leaf path to rect (`:layout`), and the
;;   composite's overall dimensions (`:width`, `:height`). Produced by
;;   `pj/pose->draft`.
;;
;; - **Plan** -- fully resolved geometry in data space (domains,
;;   ticks, legends, computed shapes). A `Plan` record (composite
;;   plots use `CompositePlan`) holding panels as plain maps, layers
;;   as `PlanLayer` records, and numeric arrays as dtype-next
;;   buffers. Produced by `pj/draft->plan`. No rendering primitives
;;   yet.
;;
;; - **Membrane** -- a `PlotjeMembrane` record carrying positioned
;;   drawing primitives (Translate, WithColor, Path, Label, ...) in
;;   drawing space, sized to the output canvas. The record itself
;;   implements the
;;   [Membrane](https://github.com/phronmophobic/membrane) library's
;;   UI protocols, so it composes with other Membrane elements.
;;   Produced by `pj/plan->membrane`. The
;;   [Membranes](./plotje_book.membranes.html) chapter walks this
;;   stage in depth.
;;
;; - **Plot** -- rendered output (SVG hiccup or BufferedImage).
;;   Produced by `pj/membrane->plot`, dispatching on a `:format`
;;   keyword.
;;
;; The composition shortcuts `pj/draft`, `pj/plan`, `pj/membrane`,
;; and `pj/plot` run the chain from a pose up through the named
;; stage. They are introduced one section down.

;; Most users only interact with the pose stage and never need to
;; think about the others. The stages below matter when you are
;; debugging unexpected output, building a custom renderer, or
;; extending the library.

;; ## Why these stages?
;;
;; A simpler library could go from data to a rendered image in one
;; function.
;; Plotje splits the work into five stages so each stage addresses
;; a distinct concern, and each boundary between stages has a
;; specific purpose:
;;
;; - The **pose** is what the user specifies.
;; - The **draft** is the
;;   same specification flattened, with scope merged in. This
;;   boundary lets the layer engine run on a uniform input
;;   regardless of how the pose was built (single layer, faceted
;;   leaf, composite tree).
;; - The **plan** holds geometry in data space -- domains, ticks,
;;   computed shapes -- before any drawing. This boundary lets you
;;   inspect and validate plot structure with Malli, and it lets
;;   multiple renderers share the same computed plan. It also carries
;;   the dimensions the layout settled on, so where each panel will sit
;;   on the canvas is decided here: `pj/frames` reports it, and the
;;   membrane stage draws into it.
;; - The **membrane** holds drawing primitives in drawing space.
;;   This boundary decouples "what to draw, where" from the output
;;   format, so SVG and raster renderers consume the same membrane
;;   tree.
;; - The **plot** is the format-specific output: SVG hiccup, a
;;   `BufferedImage`, or any other format a backend supports.
;;
;; This structure has two consequences. Every intermediate value
;; can be inspected with `kind/pprint`. The same pipeline can be
;; extended by registering new methods at any stage -- mark, stat,
;; scale, coordinate system, output format -- without modifying the
;; core.
;; The [Extensibility](./plotje_book.extensibility.html)
;; chapter walks each extension point.

;; ## The Single-Step Transitions
;;
;; Each transition is its own public function. Walk the example
;; below to see what enters and what leaves at each step. The
;; per-function reference (arities, arguments, return types) lives
;; in the [API Reference](./plotje_book.api_reference.html#pipeline).

;; ### Step 1: pj/->pose
;;
;; Lift raw data (or a pose) to a pose. Polymorphic on input: a
;; dataset becomes a leaf pose with `:data` set; an existing pose
;; flows through unchanged (idempotent). This is the structural lift
;; that lets every downstream function accept either raw data or a
;; pose. It stops there -- it sets no mapping. The default mapping
;; that makes a bare dataset render is added separately by
;; `pj/infer-mapping` (see "Where Inference Happens" below).
;;
;; The example traced through every stage is iris petal
;; measurements, with a scatter and per-species regression line.
;; Pose-level `:x`, `:y`, and `:color` mappings; two layers on top
;; of that mapping.

(def trace-pose
  (-> (rdatasets/datasets-iris)
      (pj/pose :petal-length :petal-width {:color :species})
      pj/lay-point
      (pj/lay-smooth {:stat :linear-model})))

;; The pose auto-renders as the plot it specifies:

trace-pose

(kind/test-last [(fn [v] (let [s (pj/svg-summary v)]
                           (and (= 150 (:points s))
                                (= 3 (:lines s)))))])

;; The underlying value is a plain Clojure map -- `kind/pprint`
;; reveals the structure (without it, the auto-render would re-show
;; the plot):

(kind/pprint trace-pose)

(kind/test-last [(fn [v] (and (pj/pose? v)
                              (= [:petal-length :petal-width :species]
                                 [(:x (:mapping v))
                                  (:y (:mapping v))
                                  (:color (:mapping v))])
                              (= 2 (count (:layers v)))
                              (= [:point :smooth]
                                 (mapv :layer-type (:layers v)))))])

;; ### Step 2: pj/pose->draft
;;
;; Flatten a pose into a draft. For a leaf, returns a `LeafDraft`
;; record carrying the merged layer maps and the pose-level options.
;; The pose-level mapping (`:x :petal-length`, `:y :petal-width`,
;; `:color :species`) appears inside *each* of the two layer maps,
;; alongside layer-specific keys (`:mark`, `:stat`). The layer
;; engine downstream receives a uniform shape regardless of where each
;; mapping was originally specified. Keys prefixed with double
;; underscores (e.g. `:__panel-idx`) are internal markers; they pass
;; through the plan stage and follow the Clojure "do not consume"
;; convention.

(def trace-draft
  (pj/pose->draft trace-pose))

(kind/pprint trace-draft)

(kind/test-last [(fn [d] (and (pj/leaf-draft? d)
                              (= 2 (count (:layers d)))
                              (let [layers (:layers d)]
                                (and (= [:point :line] (mapv :mark layers))
                                     (every? #(= :petal-length (:x %)) layers)
                                     (every? #(= :petal-width (:y %)) layers)
                                     (every? #(= :species (:color %)) layers)))
                              (= {} (:opts d))))])

;; ### Step 3: pj/draft->plan
;;
;; Resolve the draft into computed geometry. Reads `:opts` from the
;; draft to apply title, dimensions, axis labels, and so on. The
;; smooth layer's `:linear-model` stat resolves into per-species
;; line segments here; the point layer keeps the raw observations
;; grouped by species. The legend gets one entry per species.

(def trace-plan
  (pj/draft->plan trace-draft))

;; The plan -- a `Plan` record carrying panels, total dimensions,
;; ticks, the legend spec, and per-layer geometry (groups of
;; dtype-next buffers):

(kind/pprint trace-plan)

(kind/test-last [(fn [v] (and (pj/leaf-plan? v)
                              (= 1 (count (:panels v)))
                              (some? (:total-width v))
                              (some? (:total-height v))
                              (= 3 (count (get-in v [:legend :entries])))
                              (let [layers (:layers (first (:panels v)))]
                                (and (= [:point :line] (mapv :mark layers))
                                     (= 3 (count (:groups (first layers))))
                                     (= 3 (count (:groups (second layers))))))))])

;; The plan validates against a Malli schema:

(pj/valid-plan? trace-plan)

(kind/test-last [true?])

;; ### Step 4: pj/plan->membrane
;;
;; Convert the plan into a `PlotjeMembrane` -- a tree of membrane
;; drawing primitives positioned in drawing-space coordinates,
;; wrapped in a record that itself implements the Membrane UI
;; protocols (`IOrigin`, `IBounds`, `IChildren`).

(def trace-membrane (pj/plan->membrane trace-plan))

;; The membrane carries the rendered drawables plus the canvas size
;; and title. The drawables sit inside the record's `:drawables`
;; field; record fields `:width` and `:height` give the canvas
;; size; and `:plotje/title` carries the title (when set):

(kind/pprint trace-membrane)

(kind/test-last
 [(fn [v]
    (and (pj/membrane? v)
         (pos? (count (:drawables v)))
         (every? #(.startsWith (.getName (class %))
                               "membrane.ui.")
                 (:drawables v))))])

;; The dedicated [Membranes](./plotje_book.membranes.html#the-membrane-protocols) chapter
;; walks the record's protocols, the namespaced-attribute convention,
;; and how a `PlotjeMembrane` composes with hand-built Membrane
;; elements.

;; ### Step 5: pj/membrane->plot
;;
;; Convert the membrane into the rendered output for a chosen
;; format. Dispatches on the format keyword; `:svg` is built in.
;; This is the only stage whose output is format-native rather than
;; portable: every earlier stage is the same across backends, while
;; here the membrane becomes SVG hiccup, a BufferedImage, or another
;; format's bytes.
;; The membrane carries its plan-derived dimensions as record
;; fields (read via `(membrane.ui/width m)`/`(height m)`), so
;; `pj/membrane->plot` does not need them respelled in opts:

(def trace-plot
  (pj/membrane->plot trace-membrane :svg {}))

(kind/pprint trace-plot)

(kind/test-last [(fn [v] (and (vector? v) (= :svg (first v))))])

;; Rendered:

(kind/hiccup trace-plot)

(kind/test-last [(fn [v] (let [s (pj/svg-summary v)]
                           (and (= 1 (:panels s))
                                (= 150 (:points s))
                                (= 3 (:lines s)))))])

;; ## Pipeline Shortcuts: pj/pose, pj/draft, pj/plan, pj/membrane, pj/plot, pj/save
;;
;; Each pipeline stage has a user-facing convenience that runs the
;; chain from raw input up through that stage; `pj/save` is the
;; file-output sibling that runs the chain all the way and writes the
;; result to disk:
;;
;; - **pj/pose** -- not a literal composition. Beyond `pj/->pose`,
;;   it infers mappings from 1-3 column datasets, parses positional
;;   column arguments (e.g. `(pj/pose data :x :y)`), builds
;;   rectangular composites from `pj/cross` pair lists, and extends
;;   or promotes existing poses. Use `pj/->pose` when you only need
;;   to lift raw input to a pose without any of that.
;; - **pj/draft** -- raw input -> draft.
;; - **pj/plan** -- raw input -> plan.
;; - **pj/membrane** -- raw input -> membrane tree.
;; - **pj/plot** -- raw input -> rendered figure.
;; - **pj/save** -- raw input -> file on disk (renders, then writes).
;;
;; Each shortcut starts from raw input and stops at a different
;; stage along the same chain. The solid line is the stage-to-stage
;; pipeline; each dashed arrow is one shortcut, running from raw
;; input up to the stage it produces:

;; The shortcuts are near-literal compositions of these steps: each
;; lifts raw input with `pj/->pose`, applies the shared
;; `pj/infer-mapping` step (which gives a bare dataset a default
;; mapping and is a no-op once a pose already has one), and runs the
;; chain up to its stage. Their source shows the pipeline directly.
;; Two things are simplified below for clarity: the `pj/->pose`
;; caller-name argument -- which only tunes error messages -- is
;; elided, and `pj/pose` is shown at its 1-arity (its typed arities
;; also parse positional column arguments and build composites).
;;
;; Pseudocode:
;; ```clojure
;; (defn pose         ; 1-arity; typed arities also parse positional
;;   ([x]             ; column arguments and build composites

;;      ;; render the plan to fmt bytes and write them to path
;;      (write-file path (plan->plot (plan pose) fmt (:opts pose)))
;;      path)))
;; ```
;;
;; In `plot`, the `let` binds `pose`, `opts`, and `fmt` for use in
;; the subsequent `->` thread, which runs the four transitions
;; (`pose->draft`, `draft->plan`, `plan->membrane`, `membrane->plot`)
;; in order. The plan-derived dimensions and title are attached to
;; the membrane tree as metadata, so `membrane->plot` can read them
;; without the plan.
;;
;; `pj/save` is the file-output sibling: it lifts and infers the same
;; way, resolves the file format (from a `:format` option or the path
;; extension), renders the plan to those bytes, and writes them to
;; disk, returning the path. `resolve-format` and `write-file` above
;; stand in for that format-resolution and file-writing detail.
;;
;; The 2-arity of each function folds the options map into the pose
;; using `pj/options` before recursing into the 1-arity.
;;
;; `pj/membrane` is the analogous shortcut for the membrane stage,
;; useful for consumers that want a membrane tree without choosing
;; an output format yet -- for example a custom backend, or a target
;; that Membrane supports but Plotje has not wired in yet.
;;
;; Because the compositions call the steps, redefining a step
;; (with `with-redefs` for testing, or with a custom `defmethod` for
;; plan->membrane) takes effect in every user-facing function.

;; The composition holds at runtime:

(let [pose-with-opts (-> trace-pose
                         (pj/options {:title "Iris Petals"
                                      :x-label "Petal length"
                                      :width 700}))
      via-plan (pj/plan pose-with-opts)
      via-arrows (-> pose-with-opts
                     pj/->pose
                     pj/pose->draft
                     pj/draft->plan)]
  {:title-match (= (:title via-plan) (:title via-arrows))
   :x-label-match (= (:x-label via-plan) (:x-label via-arrows))
   :width-match (= (:width via-plan) (:width via-arrows))
   :title (:title via-plan)
   :x-label (:x-label via-plan)
   :width (:width via-plan)})

(kind/test-last [(fn [m] (and (:title-match m)
                              (:x-label-match m)
                              (:width-match m)
                              (= "Iris Petals" (:title m))
                              (= "Petal length" (:x-label m))
                              (= 700 (:width m))))])

;; Plot-level options (title, x-label, width, ...) are stored on the
;; pose's `:opts`, copied into the `LeafDraft`'s `:opts`, and read
;; by `pj/draft->plan`. Calling the steps directly, without
;; the user-facing convenience, produces the identical plan.
;;
;; The same property allows inspection at any stage: stop the chain
;; before the next step. `(-> data ... pj/pose->draft
;; kind/pprint)` shows the draft; `(-> data ... pj/pose->draft
;; pj/draft->plan)` shows the plan.

;; ## Where Inference Happens
;;
;; Two of the steps also **infer**: they fill in choices the user
;; did not specify. Inference is what lets a dataset alone -- with
;; no mapping, no layers, no options -- produce a complete plot. Most
;; one-line examples in this book rely on inference at one or both
;; of these stages. The
;; [Inference Rules](./plotje_book.inference_rules.html) chapter is
;; the authoritative reference for what each stage infers.

(pj/pose {:x [1 2 3 4 5]
          :y [2 4 3 5 4]
          :g [:a :a :b :b :b]})

(kind/test-last [(fn [v] (let [s (pj/svg-summary v)]
                           (and (= 1 (:panels s))
                                (= 5 (:points s))
                                (= 2 (count (filter #(.startsWith % "rgb")
                                                    (:colors s)))))))])

;; Where each kind of inference lives:
;;
;; - **Mapping inference** fills in a position/color mapping from the
;;   first 1-3 columns: 1 column to `:x`, 2 columns to `:x` and `:y`,
;;   3 columns add `:color`. It runs at the user-facing entry points
;;   that accept raw data -- `pj/pose` (1-arity) and the shortcuts
;;   `pj/draft`, `pj/plan`, `pj/membrane`, `pj/plot`, and `pj/save`,
;;   which all apply the shared public step `pj/infer-mapping` (a
;;   no-op once a pose has a mapping). `pj/lay-*` (1-arity) infers the
;;   same way but throws on 4+ columns rather than falling through.
;;   Inference never lives in `pj/->pose`, which only lifts data into
;;   a bare mapping-less leaf -- so `pj/infer-mapping` is a public step
;;   you can drop into a hand-built pipeline, and raw data handed to a
;;   shortcut renders the same default as `pj/pose` would.
;; - **Layer-type inference** lives in `pj/draft->plan`. A pose
;;   without an explicit `pj/lay-*` call drafts to a layer with no
;;   `:mark` set; the plan stage detects the missing mark, looks
;;   at the column types, and picks a concrete mark + stat --
;;   categorical x with numerical y produces a boxplot, temporal x
;;   with numerical y produces a time-series line, numerical x and
;;   y produce a scatter, and so on.
;; - **Column-type inference** lives in `pj/draft->plan`.
;;   `:x-type`/`:y-type`/`:color-type` default from the data
;;   (numerical / categorical / temporal); a user-supplied
;;   `:x-type` overrides the default.
;; - **Geometry inference** lives in `pj/draft->plan`. Domains
;;   default to data ranges; ticks default to evenly-spaced
;;   values; legend entries are derived from the layers' aesthetic
;;   mappings; the coordinate system defaults to `:cartesian`.
;;
;; All but mapping inference happens in the plan stage. Mapping
;; inference runs earlier -- before any draft exists -- so the rest
;; of the pipeline always receives a pose with mappings. The plan stage
;; is where the geometry, types, and layer choice are resolved: the
;; draft may leave them unspecified, and the plan fills them in.
;; Every inferred default has an explicit override (`pj/scale`,
;; `pj/coord`, `pj/options`, mapping keys like `:x-type`), so the
;; user can opt out of any single inference without losing the
;; others.

;; ## Composite Poses
;;
;; A composite pose -- one with `:poses` inside --
;; flows through the same steps. Each step dispatches
;; internally on shape: a leaf pose produces a `LeafDraft`; a
;; composite pose produces a `CompositeDraft`. The user-facing
;; pipeline is unchanged.

;; `pj/draft` (the composition of `->pose`, `infer-mapping` and

;; `pj/plan` returns a `CompositePlan`:

;; `pj/membrane` returns a `PlotjeMembrane` whose `:drawables` carry
;; one `Translate` per leaf plus composite framing (column strip
;; labels, shared legend, title if any). Plan-derived width and height
;; are record fields, and the title is `:plotje/title`.

                              (pos? (count (:drawables m)))

                              (number? (membrane.ui/height m))))])

;; `pj/plot` (the full pipeline) returns the SVG hiccup -- the
;; same value `composite-pose` auto-renders to at the top of this
;; section, produced explicitly:

(-> composite-pose pj/plot kind/pprint)

(kind/test-last [(fn [v] (let [s (pj/svg-summary v)]
                           (and (= 2 (:panels s))
                                (= 300 (:points s)))))])

;; The composition holds for both leaf and composite poses --
;; `pj/plan` is `(-> pose pj/->pose pj/pose->draft pj/draft->plan)`
;; either way -- because each step dispatches on shape at
;; the bottom of its call.

;; The composite path also performs cross-leaf work that has no
;; per-leaf analogue. When the composite carries
;; `{:share-scales #{:x :y}}`, `pj/pose->draft` computes domains
;; across all leaves and inserts them into each per-leaf draft
;; before `pj/draft->plan` runs, so the resulting panels share
;; axes. Shared-scale resolution belongs to the composite stage
;; rather than per-leaf planning. See the
;; [Composition](./plotje_book.composition.html#shared-scales) chapter for worked
;; examples.

;; ## The Plan Boundary
;;
;; The plan is the first pipeline boundary: the boundary between
;; description and rendering. The
;; pose and draft stages assemble the description. The plan resolves
;; it into computed geometry, domains, ticks, and legend -- still as
;; inspectable data, before any layout. The membrane and plot stages
;; then produce the rendered output.

")

;; The plan is inspectable as data -- `Plan` and `PlanLayer` records
;; (which behave as maps), plain maps, numbers, strings, keywords,
;; and dtype-next buffers for numeric arrays. It validates against a
;; Malli schema.
;;
;; This separation enables:
;;
;; - Inspecting the plan without rendering
;;
;; - Validating plot structure with Malli
;;
;; - Adding alternate backends that consume plans (SVG and raster
;;   are implemented today)

;; ## The Membrane Stage
;;
;; The membrane is the second pipeline boundary: it separates
;; data-space geometry from output-format bytes. The plan describes
;; what to draw in data coordinates (e.g. a point at (3.4, 7.1) in
;; the color for species `setosa`); the membrane describes the same
;; content in drawing coordinates (e.g. a translation to (218, 134)
;; carrying a colored shape). The plan is renderer-agnostic; the
;; membrane is format-agnostic.
;;
;; Clipping -- keeping each panel's marks within the panel -- is an
;; instance of this same translation. A panel's domain, resolved at the
;; plan stage, is a data-space fact: the range of values the panel
;; shows. The membrane turns it into a drawing-space clip that hides
;; any geometry reaching past that window, so a mark cannot paint
;; outside its panel, or into a neighbor in a multi-panel layout. The
;; [Membranes](./plotje_book.membranes.html#clipping-marks-to-the-panel) chapter shows the
;; mechanism; the [Glossary](./plotje_book.glossary.html#clip) has an entry
;; for **clip**.
;;
;; This boundary lets one membrane tree be rendered to many output
;; formats. The pose, draft, plan, and membrane stages are reused
;; unchanged across formats. A new format that consumes the membrane
;; tree registers a `defmethod` on the render multimethod
;; `scicloj.plotje.impl.render/membrane->plot` (the public
;; `pj/membrane->plot` dispatches through it). A new format that
;; goes from a plan directly to bytes (skipping membrane -- e.g., a
;; Plotly-spec target) registers a `defmethod` on
;; `scicloj.plotje.impl.render/plan->plot` instead. The
;; [Extensibility](./plotje_book.extensibility.html) chapter shows a
;; worked backend registration.
;;
;; The membrane stage of Plotje is built on
;; [Membrane](https://github.com/phronmophobic/membrane) -- the
;; library that defines the primitive types Plotje uses
;; (`Translate`, `WithColor`, `Path`, `Label`, `RoundedRectangle`,
;; ...) and provides the rendering backends. Plotje constructs a
;; membrane tree from a plan; Membrane renders it.
;;
;; Backends Plotje wires into Membrane today:
;;
;; - **SVG hiccup** -- the default. Renders in browsers, in
;;   notebooks via Kindly/Clay, and writes to `.svg` files.
;; - **Java2D / `BufferedImage`** -- raster output via
;;   Membrane's Java2D backend. Used for `.png` files and any
;;   consumer that wants a Java image.
;;
;; Membrane itself supports more rendering targets (terminal,
;; native GUI, GL, ...) than Plotje currently exposes. Wiring a new
;; target into Plotje has not been done end-to-end yet -- the
;; defmethod registration is the extension point, but each backend
;; has its own conventions for opts and interactivity that need to
;; be worked out. As Membrane grows, Plotje can incorporate new
;; targets without changing how plots are described.

;; `impl/pose.clj` holds the core pose operations: `resolve-tree` (merges
;; mappings/data/options down from root to every leaf), `leaf->draft`
;; (the leaf-pose flattening that the public `pj/pose->draft` calls),
;; and the multi-pair / grid composite utilities.
;;
;; `impl/compositor.clj` handles composite framing layout,
;; `composite-pose->draft`, and `composite-draft->plan` -- pure
;; data-side, no membrane dependency.
;;
;; `impl/plan.clj` holds the leaf-plan computation (domains, ticks,
;; legends, layout) that the public `pj/draft->plan` calls.
;;
;; `impl/resolve.clj` defines the `Plan`, `CompositePlan`,
;; `LeafDraft`, `CompositeDraft`, `PlanLayer`, and `LayerType`
;; records, and holds `resolve-draft-layer` (single draft layer
;; resolution, column type inference, grouping).
;;
;; The `impl/` directory is pure data with no membrane dependency.
;; The `render/` directory uses membrane for layout and SVG/raster
;; conversion. `render/composite.clj` carries the composite

;; composite framing (title, strip labels, shared legend).

;; ## Dependencies
;;
;; Plotje builds on several Clojure libraries:
;;
;; - [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) &

;;   rendering and layout
;;
;; - [Wadogo](https://github.com/scicloj/wadogo) -- scales
;;
;; - [Clojure2d](https://github.com/Clojure2D/clojure2d) --
;;   color palettes and gradients
;;

;;   [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) -- notebook rendering

;; ## What's Next
;;
;; - [**Exploring Plans**](./plotje_book.exploring_plans.html) -- a hands-on tour of the plan stage, building intuition for the data shape that the pipeline produces
;; - [**Extensibility**](./plotje_book.extensibility.html) -- add custom marks, stats, scales, coordinate systems, and output formats by extending the multimethods at each pipeline stage
