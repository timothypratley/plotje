   `rows` arrives from `pairs->rows` with one row per y column and one

     auto-render if it is not already tagged.
   - `(pj/pose fr :x-col :y-col)` -- extend a leaf-without-position, or
     promote a leaf-with-position into a 2-panel composite, or append a
     panel to a composite.
   - `(pj/pose fr :x-col :y-col {:color :c})` -- same, with aesthetic
     routed to the composite root on promote.
   - `(pj/pose fr {:color :c})` -- aesthetic-only: extend mapping or
     (on leaf-with-position) promote.
   - `(pj/pose fr {:data X :color :c})` -- extend mapping AND replace the
     top-level data with X.

   **On a hand-built pose-shaped map (1-arity, input has `:layers`,
   `:poses`, or a map-valued `:mapping`):** the map is validated and tagged with Kindly auto-render
   metadata, but its keys are not reordered and its `:data` is not
   coerced -- the typed shape is preserved verbatim. A composite is
   supported at any depth: a sub-pose that itself has `:poses` nests,
   which is the shape `pj/arrange` builds and the shape it accepts
   among its own inputs.

   **Writing a mapping out in full.** Any mapping value may be written
   as a map naming its source, and optionally which side of the scale
   to read it through:

   - `{:column :species}` -- the column, even where a value of that
     name could be drawn.
   - `{:value \"blue\"}` -- the color, even where the data carries a
     column called blue.
   - `{:scale false}` -- draw the value as it stands rather than pass
     it through the aesthetic's scale. On a column this is the only
     route to an identity scale: `{:color {:column :hex :scale false}}`
     draws the colors the column holds.
   - `{:scale true}` -- read it as data. `{:color {:value \"Model A\"
     :scale true}}` draws one palette color and earns a legend entry.

   The conventions decide when `:scale` is absent: a column passes
   through the scale, a written value is drawn on the appearance
   aesthetics and is a data value on `:x` and `:y`. See
   `pj/layer-option-docs` for what each aesthetic accepts, and
   `pj/scale` for choosing a scale's type."

   Nothing about *where* the mapping is written enters into it. A
   number is left to the ordinary convention wherever it appears: the
   layer's data is asked at draft time, a name it carries is that
   column, and anything else is a value the axis scales into a datum.
   So `{:x 0}` reads column 0 on a dataset that has one and places
   every mark at zero on a dataset that does not, whether it was
   written in `pj/pose`, in a `lay-*` positional argument, or in a
   layer's options map.

   This gate used to refuse a bare number outside a layer's options

   cannot tell a column name from a place. That reasoning does not
   hold: the source question is answered at draft time for every other
   mapping, and answering it here as well is what makes the rule one
   rule. `{:column 0}` and `{:value 0}` remain the way to say which
   reading is meant where a reader of the code could not tell.

   Where the explicit form may be written is a separate question, and

   `(pj/lay-point data {:column 0} :b)` and
   `(pj/lay-point data :a {:column :b} {:color :sp})` both read the map

   `tc/pivot->longer` reads a column name that looks like a number as
   one, so a wide table of years gives an `:int64` key column. The

   continuous or categorical from the type, so the years were drawn as
   a gradient: one group, no legend entries, and every measure in one
   colour. The pivot knows what the column holds and says so here,
   rather than leaving the colour to infer it from values that no
   longer mean what they look like.

   Two guards. It is written only where the column really is numeric,
   so an ordinary series carries no `:color-type` and a reader
   inspecting that pose sees only what they wrote. And only where the
   writer has said nothing about the colour's type at either scope --
   the pivot writes into a layer's mapping, which outranks a pose's, so
   writing unconditionally would override an explicit `:color-type` on

  "Add a `:bar` layer type.

   - One column (x only): counts occurrences of each category. Requires a
     categorical x.
   - Two columns (x and y): uses the y value directly as the bar height.

   The stat is inferred from whether a y column is present, and overridable:
   pass `{:stat :count}` to count even with a y column, or `{:stat :identity}`
   to require an explicit height. `:color` (with `:position` `:dodge`/`:stack`)
   gives grouped or stacked bars.

   The categorical axis can be x (vertical bars) or y (horizontal bars):
   `(pj/lay-bar :value :category)` with a categorical y draws horizontal value
   bars, no `pj/coord` needed. (Stacked/filled horizontal bars are not yet
   supported directly -- put the category on x and add `(pj/coord :flip)`.)
   To treat a numeric column as categorical, pass `{:x-type :categorical}`
   (or `{:y-type :categorical}`).

   When both axes are numeric or temporal (`(pj/lay-bar :x :y)` with no
   categorical axis), each bar sits at its x position with a width taken from
   `0.9` of the smallest gap between adjacent x values -- a time-series or
   numeric-position bar chart. Grouped numeric bars currently overlap rather
   than dodge.

   `:bar-width` sets how wide a bar is drawn, in the unit its axis offers. On
   a categorical axis it is the fraction of the category band the bar fills,
   `0.8` by default, as `:box-width` is for a box: `{:bar-width 0.4}` draws a
   bar half the usual thickness, which is how a second bar layer is read as an
   overlay rather than a stack. On a numeric or temporal axis, where there is
   no band, it is a width in data units."

(defn overlay
  "Mark a pose so that its layers are drawn on one panel, instead of a
   layer naming columns the panel does not draw taking a panel of its
   own.

   A layer naming columns the panel does not draw cannot share that
   panel's axes, so by default it becomes a panel of its own. That is
   the right answer for two unrelated pairs of columns and the wrong one
   for two measures meant to be read against one axis. `pj/overlay`
   turns that default off:

   - `(-> data pj/overlay (pj/lay-bar :growth :cohort) (pj/lay-bar :tax :cohort))`

   The layer keeps its own columns; they are drawn against the axes the
   panel already has, and each axis covers every column drawn on it.
   Each layer takes a colour and a legend entry naming its column, and
   an axis title names every column drawn on it. Where each layer writes
   its own colour, the axis is named for the panel's own column.

   `pj/overlay` says the same thing wherever in a pipeline it is
   written. It is read where the panels are decided rather than where a
   layer is added, so writing it after the layers draws what writing it
   before them draws.

   `{:overlay true}` on one `lay-*` call joins that layer alone,
   `{:overlay false}` opts one layer out, and `(pj/overlay pose false)`
   turns it off for the pose. A layer whose columns already match the
   panel is unaffected -- it was joining anyway.

   Where the columns are written makes no difference: an `:x` or `:y` in
   the options map asks for a panel exactly as one in an argument slot
   does, and `pj/overlay` answers both. A written value names no panel
   -- `{:x 7.5 :y 4.2 :text \"note\"}` marks a place on the panel it is
   added to -- so a written value needs no overlay."

(defn scale
  "Set scale on a pose. The scale applies to the pose it is called on
   and to everything below it: called on the pose you are building, it
   covers the whole plot; called on one cell before the cells are
   arranged, that cell alone, so two cells can carry different scales.
   Under faceting every panel comes from one pose, so the panels share
   a type; `:scales :free` varies their domains.

   A mapping written out in full can name a scale too, for that one
   mapping: `{:size {:column :weight :scale :log}}`. Where a scale is
   set at more than one scope the settings accumulate and the inner
   scope wins, key by key. Written on the same pose, this call is the
   inner one; written on a layer, the layer's mapping is.

   Accepts a type keyword or a scale spec map. `:type` and `:domain`
   belong to every scale. The rest are per aesthetic, and a key an
   aesthetic does not read is refused where it is written rather than
   dropped in silence:

   - Every aesthetic takes `:label`, the title of whatever explains its
     scale to a reader: the axis for `:x` and `:y`, the legend for the
     rest. It wins over the `<aesthetic>-label` plot option -- `:x-label`,
     `:color-label` and their siblings -- which names the same thing one
     scope further out.
   - `:x` and `:y` take `:include`, a value the axis has to reach, or a
     collection of them. `{:include 0}` puts zero on the axis so that
     lengths drawn along it are proportional to the values, and the
     value lands exactly at the edge of the panel. `:include` extends
     the extent the data gives where `:domain` replaces it, so the two
     are not written together, and it is a set of values where a
     `:domain` is an ordered pair.
   - `:x` and `:y` take `:breaks` (explicit tick locations; `[]`
     draws the axis with no ticks, tick labels or grid lines, as
     ggplot2's `breaks = NULL` does, while `nil` leaves the default
     ticks),
     `:tick-labels` (custom tick text paired with `:breaks`),
     `:n-ticks` (about this many ticks) and `:tick-spacing` (about
     this much room in drawing units per tick). A numeric axis reads
     whichever of the last two is named; a categorical one is ticked at
     its categories, which `:n-ticks` thins.
   - `:size` and `:alpha` take `:range` -- what the aesthetic spans, in
     the quantity the mark draws it as, so `[2 8]` on `:size` is a
     radius in drawing units.
   - `:size` further takes `:by`, how a value spreads across that range
     (`:sqrt` by default, or `:linear` or `:area`), and `:from-zero`,
     which anchors both the domain and the range at zero so that twice
     the value is twice the ink.
   - `:shape` takes `:values`, the marker symbols to draw with.
   - `:color` and `:fill` take `:range`, the gradient a numeric column
     is read through; `:color` also takes `:values`, the colours a
     categorical column is drawn in. Both take `:midpoint`, the value
     the middle of the gradient is drawn at.

   A value outside `:domain` is drawn at the nearer end rather than
   dropped, so a narrower domain says what the reader should compare
   without leaving rows off the panel. On an axis a `:domain` is two
   finite numbers, or two dates where the column is temporal; against a
   categorical column it is the list of categories, in the order they
   are to be drawn.

   Aesthetics and accepted scale types:

   - The axis aesthetics (`:x`, `:y`) accept `:linear`, `:log`,
     `:categorical`.
   - The continuous appearance aesthetics (`:size`, `:alpha`, `:fill`,
     `:color`) accept `:linear` and `:log` only -- `:categorical` does
     not apply.
   - The discrete appearance aesthetic `:shape` accepts `:categorical`
     only -- `:linear` and `:log` do not apply to a discrete encoding.

   `:group` is refused: it draws nothing of its own, so there is no
   scale to set. It splits a layer into one drawn group per value, and
   the order of those groups is the order of the data.

   To take an aesthetic off its scale for one mapping rather than
   choose a type for the whole plot, write that mapping out in full:
   `{:color {:column :hex :scale false}}` draws the column's values as
   they stand, and `{:size {:value 7 :scale true}}` sends a written
   value through the scale. See the layer option docs for `:color` and
   `:size`.

   A `:domain` has two readings, and the domain itself decides which:
   two numbers are a range, and anything else is a list of categories.

   On a categorical `:color` or `:shape` column it gives the
   order the categories are placed in, which the legend and the palette
   both follow. A category the list leaves out is still drawn, ordered
   after the ones listed, with a warning. On `:shape`, `:values`
   supplies the symbols to draw those categories with in that same
   order; `pj/shape-symbols` lists the ones available.

   On a numeric `:color` or `:fill` column it gives the two ends of the
   gradient, as it gives the ends of the drawn range on `:size` and
   `:alpha`. That is how every panel of a facet can be given one scale
   to share.

   `:tick-labels` requires `:breaks` and must match it in count. Use it
   to draw numeric breaks with text of your own -- for example, days of
   the week on a tile heatmap.

   `:n-ticks` asks for about that many ticks. On a categorical axis it
   thins a crowded one, which otherwise labels every category; on a
   numeric axis it replaces the count that `:tick-spacing` would give.
   `:tick-spacing` asks for about that much room, in drawing units,
   per tick, and the count follows from how many fit. It is a target
   in the way `:n-ticks` is: the ticks are still rounded to values a
   reader can read off, so the room each one ends up with can come out
   under the number asked for. It steers the choice of numeric ticks
   and does nothing on a categorical axis, which says so. The `:x-tick-spacing` / `:y-tick-spacing` plot options name the
   same setting one scope further out.

   - `(scale pose :x :log)` -- log scale on x-axis.
   - `(scale pose :x {:type :categorical :domain [...]})` -- explicit
     category order.
   - `(scale pose :x {:n-ticks 8})` -- about eight ticks, which on a
     crowded categorical axis thins it to eight of its categories.
   - `(scale pose :y {:type :linear :breaks [0 5 10]})` -- pin tick locations.
   - `(scale pose :x {:type :linear :breaks [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
                      :tick-labels [\"Mon\" \"Tue\" \"Wed\" \"Thu\" \"Fri\" \"Sat\" \"Sun\"]})`
     -- numeric positions with custom tick text.
   - `(scale pose :y {:type :log :domain [1 1000]})` -- log scale with
     explicit range.
   - `(scale pose :size :log)` -- log-spaced point sizes.
   - `(scale pose :size {:range [3 14]})` -- wider points than the

  "Where a plot's panels sit on the canvas, and how to get between data

   Takes a plan or a pose; a pose is planned first. Returns a map:

   - `:panels` -- one entry per panel, each carrying `:row`, `:col`,
     `:coord`, `:x-domain`, `:y-domain`, `:x-scale`, `:y-scale`,
     `:invertible?` and `:frames`

   A panel's `:frames` names two rectangles, both `[x y width height]`
   in canvas coordinates: `:panel-box` (the panel with its axis margin)
   and `:drawing-area` (the background inside that margin, where data
   marks are clipped). The canvas is reported once, at the top: it
   belongs to the plot rather than to any panel.

   The result contains no functions, so it can be printed, compared and
   read back from `pr-str`. To map between the spaces, pass a panel entry
   to `pj/to-drawing` or `pj/to-data`.

   For a composite, every cell's panels report canvas coordinates, so
   their rectangles can be compared without further arithmetic.

   This is the same computation the renderer draws with. Use it to place
   your own annotations beside a plot, to compose a Plotje membrane with
   hand-built Membrane views, or to read a pointer position back as data.

   Takes a panel entry -- an element of `(:panels (frames plot))` -- and
   either one x and y, or a dataset of them with `:x` and `:y` columns.
   The dataset arity maps whole columns and builds the panel's scales
   once, so it is the one to reach for when placing many of them.

   - `(to-drawing panel 3.2 21.0)` returns `[x y]` in canvas coordinates
   - `(to-drawing panel {:x [3.2 4.0] :y [21.0 18.5]})` returns a dataset
     with the same two column names, now in canvas coordinates

   A dataset rather than a collection of pairs because the two
   coordinates of a point share one index space, which a dataset states
   and two loose sequences only promise. Anything `tc/dataset` coerces
   works.

   The result is in canvas coordinates, measured from the top left of the
   whole image. A `{:in :drawing-area}` layer measures from the drawing
   area's own corner instead, so drawing these coordinates back means
   subtracting that corner first.

   A pose, a plan or the whole frames map in the panel's place is
   refused, with a message naming which of them it got and the call that
   reaches a panel entry from there.

   A categorical axis is a band scale, and it answers two kinds of
   value. A category sits at the middle of its band. A number is a
   place among the categories, counted from one: `1` is the first
   category, `1.5` sits halfway to the second, and on `n` categories
   the axis runs from `0.5` to `n + 0.5`. Anything else throws, naming
   the value and the categories it could have been -- a category the
   axis does not carry, or a number past the ends of the axis.
   Under `:coord :flip` the arguments stay in data order, even though a
   panel entry's `:x-domain` and `:y-domain` describe the drawn axes and
   the flip has already swapped those."

(defn to-data
  "What data values the canvas coordinates name, for one panel of

   Throws under a coordinate system with no inverse. `:polar` maps x and
   y together to an angle and a radius, so a canvas position there does
   not name one pair of data values. A panel entry reports which case it
   is in `:invertible?`.

   - `(to-data panel 412.0 88.5)` returns `[x y]` in data values
   - `(to-data panel {:x [412.0] :y [88.5]})` returns a dataset with the
     same two column names, now in data values

   A continuous axis answers with numbers, so its column is `:float64`,
   and a coordinate `pj/to-drawing` produced comes back as the value it
   was given. A categorical axis answers with the category whose band
   holds the coordinate, so its column holds those -- which is what an
   interaction wants, and is not the inverse of `pj/to-drawing` there:
   a place between two categories, such as `1.5`, comes back as one of
   them.

   The let lifts the pose once so the chain can pluck pose-level

   Returns a `PlotjeMembrane` -- a Membrane UI component (implements
   `IOrigin`, `IBounds`, `IChildren`) carrying the rendered drawables
   plus plan-derived width and height; the title, when set, rides as
   `:plotje/title`. Render-time options (`:tooltip`, `:theme`,
   `:color-values`, `:color-range`, `:color-midpoint`) ride along on the
   pose's `:opts` and reach `plan->membrane` through this call.

   Useful for exploring rendering targets beyond the SVG and Java2D
   backends Plotje wires in today: any Membrane backend can consume
   the result of `pj/membrane` via the standard Membrane protocols.

   On a composite pose, leaves are rendered individually and tiled

   The pose flows through the canonical

(defn arrange
  "Arrange multiple poses in a grid. Returns a composite pose
   that renders through the compositor via membrane -- so `:svg`,
   `:bufimg`, and any other membrane target work uniformly.

   Each input is a pose, leaf or composite. A composite input becomes a
   cell holding its own grid. `nil` is a cell left empty: it keeps its
   place in the layout and draws nothing, whatever data and layers the
   composite carries. Pre-rendered hiccup is not accepted;
   build your own `[:div ...]` if you need to combine already-rendered
   values outside the library.

   Opts:

   - `:cols` -- explicit column count (default: min(4, n-plots)).
   - `:title` -- centered title band above the grid.
   - `:width` -- total composite width.
   - `:height` -- total composite height.
   - `:share-scales` -- subset of `#{:x :y}` shared across cells
     (default: `#{}`).
   - `:align-panels` -- give every cell the same drawing area, by
     reserving the widest y-label pad and legend column a cell needs on
     all of them (and, for a row, the tallest x-label pad). Two cells
     whose y axes label at different widths otherwise get different
     panel widths, so a shared x axis covers a different extent in
     each. Pair it with `:share-scales` where the cells are meant to be
     read against one another.

   - `(arrange [fr-a fr-b] {:cols 1 :share-scales #{:x} :align-panels true})`
     -- a column of cells whose x axes line up.
   - `(arrange [fr-a fr-b])` -- 1x2 row.
   - `(arrange [fr-a fr-b fr-c] {:cols 2 :width 900})` -- 2x2 grid (wraps).
   - `(arrange [[fr-a fr-b] [fr-c fr-d]])` -- explicit 2x2 grid.

   **Given data first**, the cells are drawn from it, so a cell need
   say no more than which columns its panel draws and the layers are
   added once at the root:

   - `(-> data (arrange [{:x :a :y :b} {:x :c :y :d}]) (lay-point))`
   - `(-> data (arrange cells {:cols 2}) (lay-point))`

(defn save
  "Save a plot to a file. Format resolution, in precedence order:
   1. `:format` in the 3-arity `opts` map wins (must be `:svg` or
      `:png`).
   2. `:format` on the pose's `:opts` (`:svg` or `:png`; legacy
      `:bufimg` is translated to `:png`).
   3. Otherwise inferred from the path extension (`.svg` -> `:svg`,
      `.png` -> `:png`).
   4. Default `:svg`.

   When the resolved format and the path extension disagree, prints
   a warning -- the file still gets the bytes the resolved format
   produces, but the extension is misleading.

   The save vocabulary names the file format. The plot vocabulary
   (`pj/plot`'s `:format`) names the JVM return type -- `:svg` for
   hiccup, `:bufimg` for a Java2D BufferedImage. A pose-level
   `:format` flows into both contexts; save reinterprets `:bufimg`
   as `:png` because the file on disk is a PNG.

   Arguments:

   - `pose` -- a pose, or raw data (a dataset or a bare collection of
     values), which is given a default mapping first, exactly as
     `pj/pose` would.
   - `path` -- file path (string or `java.io.File`).
   - `opts` -- same options as plot, but `:format` accepts only `:svg`
     or `:png`.

   Tooltip and brush interactivity are not included in saved files.

   Returns the written file as a `java.io.File` carrying `:kind/image`
   metadata, so evaluating a `pj/save` call in a notebook also shows
   the saved chart. The file prints as its path and compares equal to
   a plain `java.io.File` on the same path, so `(str (pj/save ...))`
   still gives the path string.

   - `(save my-pose \"plot.svg\")` -- SVG.
   - `(save my-pose \"plot.png\")` -- inferred PNG.
   - `(save my-pose \"plot.svg\" {:format :png})` -- opts override (warns)."
